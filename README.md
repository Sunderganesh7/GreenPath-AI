# 🌱 GreenPath AI

### AI-Powered Environmental Intelligence Platform

> Tree Detection • Green Cover Analysis • Environmental Impact Intelligence • Sustainable Urban Planning

---

## 🚀 Overview

**GreenPath AI** is an end-to-end AI-powered environmental analysis platform built using **Flask and YOLOv8**.

The system analyzes environmental images to:

* Detect and count trees
* Measure green cover percentage
* Generate density heatmaps
* Estimate carbon absorption
* Analyze urban heat reduction
* Classify smart zones
* Recommend plantation areas
* Generate automated environmental reports

This project integrates **Artificial Intelligence, Environmental Science, and Web Development** into one scalable solution.
