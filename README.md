# 🌱 GreenPath AI

AI-Powered Environmental Intelligence Platform for Tree Detection, Green Cover Analysis, and Sustainable Urban Planning.


---

## 📌 Project Description

GreenPath AI is a Flask-based AI system that analyzes environmental images using **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**.

The platform detects trees, measures green cover percentage, generates environmental impact insights, and provides plantation recommendations to support sustainable development.

This project combines **AI, Environmental Science, and Web Development** into one scalable system.
